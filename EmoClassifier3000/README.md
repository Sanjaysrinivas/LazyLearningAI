# EmoClassifier3000: Because Machines Know Your Feelings Better Than You

Welcome to **EmoClassifier3000**, where two AI models—**TextBlob** (the laid-back, easy-going analyst) and **BERT** (the intense, overthinking genius)—compete to analyze your feelings. Will they understand your tweets, reviews, and late-night ramblings? Probably not, but they’ll give it a good shot!

## What This Project Does

- **TextBlob**: "You sound happy or sad... I think."
- **BERT**: "Here’s your mood, plus a confidence score, because I’m always right."

## How It Works

1. **Input a sentence**: Whether you're mad about your coffee or happy about a vacation.
2. **TextBlob guesses**: Very chill, "I think you're positive."
3. **BERT analyzes deeply**: Looks at your soul with scientific precision, then tells you exactly what you feel.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install the dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Run `sentiment_analysis.py`.
4. Sit back and let the AI tell you how you feel.

## Example

```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

**TextBlob**: Positive  
**BERT**: POSITIVE, Confidence: 1.00

## Conclusion

If you ever find yourself wondering how you feel, EmoClassifier3000 is here to remind you—with cold, unemotional precision.
