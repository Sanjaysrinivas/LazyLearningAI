### Word-by-Word Breakdown: sentiment_analysis.py

---

#### 1. **Imports and Libraries**

```python
from textblob import TextBlob
from transformers import pipeline
```

- **from**: We’re asking Python to bring in a few tools. Instead of writing complex models, we’re too lazy, so we import someone else’s hard work.
- **textblob**: A simple NLP library to guess emotions. Like the friend who gives relationship advice without fully listening.
- **pipeline**: HuggingFace’s “everything-in-one” solution for NLP tasks. This will let us use BERT, the AI who takes everything seriously.

---

#### 2. **TextBlob Sentiment Analysis**

```python
def textblob_sentiment(text):
    blob = TextBlob(text)
    sentiment_score = blob.sentiment.polarity
    return "Positive" if sentiment_score > 0 else "Negative" if sentiment_score < 0 else "Neutral"
```

- **def**: We’re defining a function because we don’t want to repeat ourselves. Lazy coders unite!
- **textblob_sentiment**: This function’s job is to tell us if a sentence is happy, sad, or just “meh.”
- **blob = TextBlob(text)**: Creating a “blob” from the text. It sounds funny, but it’s actually just a chunk of text that TextBlob can analyze.
- **blob.sentiment.polarity**: This line pulls a sentiment score between -1 (super negative) and 1 (super positive). Neutral sits comfortably at 0, where emotions are dead inside.
- **return**: Finally, we return a label based on the sentiment score. Positive if above 0, Negative if below 0, and Neutral if we’re stuck in the middle of a boring meeting.

#### 3. **BERT Sentiment Analysis**

```python
def bert_sentiment(text):
    sentiment_model = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
    result = sentiment_model(text)
    return result[0]['label'], result[0]['score']
```

- **def**: Another function! This time we let **BERT** (Big Emotional Robotic Therapist) take a crack at our feelings.
- **pipeline("sentiment-analysis")**: We’re creating a BERT-based sentiment analyzer. This AI will scan your text with the intensity of Sherlock Holmes looking for clues.
- **result = sentiment_model(text)**: BERT will analyze the text and spit out a result, which contains the emotion **label** (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE) and **confidence score** (because BERT is confident like that).
- **return**: We’re returning two things here—**label** (the emotion) and **score** (BERT’s confidence level, as if it needed more ego).

---

#### 4. **Main Function**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_text = "I absolutely love this project! It's amazing!"
    print(f"TextBlob Sentiment: {textblob_sentiment(test_text)}")
    label, confidence = bert_sentiment(test_text)
    print(f"BERT Sentiment: {label}, Confidence: {confidence:.2f}")
```

- **if **name** == "**main**"**: This is Python’s way of asking, "Should I actually run this code or just define it?" If we run the script directly, it’ll execute everything inside this block.
- **test_text**: Here’s our emotionally charged test sentence—clearly, we’re in a great mood today!
- **textblob_sentiment**: First, we ask TextBlob what it thinks about our happiness. TextBlob will analyze the sentence and casually tell us we’re positive.
- **bert_sentiment**: Now it’s BERT’s turn. BERT will give us a more detailed response with confidence. It’ll confirm we’re positive, probably with an overconfidence score of **1.00** (because BERT’s just that sure).
