### README for Random Forest Classifier - Iris Dataset

#### Project Overview

Welcome to the **Random Forest Classifier** project using the famous **Iris dataset**! In this project, we harness the power of Random Forest, a powerful ensemble learning method, to classify Iris flowers into three species based on petal and sepal measurements.

#### Features

- **Data Visualization**: We use `seaborn` to create pair plots and heatmaps for better understanding of the data and model performance.
- **Random Forest Model**: An ensemble of decision trees working together to make predictions.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the model with a confusion matrix and classification report.

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed and the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

#### Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required libraries with:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook.

#### Usage

Follow the steps in the notebook:

1. Load the Iris dataset.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train the Random Forest model.
4. Evaluate and visualize the results.
