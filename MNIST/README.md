### README.md for the MNIST Digit Recognition Project

#### Project Overview

Welcome to our MNIST Digit Recognition project, where we dive deep into the world of neural networks by classifying handwritten digits. If you've never seen this dataset in tutorials, you've probably been living under a rock.

#### Features

- **Training with TensorFlow**: Experience the magic of TensorFlow as we push pixels around to recognize digits.
- **Visual Insights**: Use matplotlib to actually see what the model is learning.
- **Evaluation**: Assess how well our model guesses which numbers are which.

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed, and while you're at it, grab these packages if you don't want to crash spectacularly:

- `tensorflow`
- `matplotlib`

#### Installation

1. Clone this repo like your project depends on it (because it does).
2. Install the required libraries with `pip install tensorflow matplotlib`—or just yell at your computer until it works.

#### Usage

Run each cell in the provided Jupyter notebook. Marvel as the model learns to recognize numbers like a kindergartner learning to count.

#### How to Contribute

Feel like adding more layers to the model? Fork it. Want to tweak the epochs? Go for it. Submit a pull request when you've done something cool or just less terrible.

#### Enjoy

Get ready to see a computer do what a 5-year-old can—recognize digits. Only slower and with a lot more math.

### Get Started!

Head over to the Jupyter notebook and start training your model. Watch those numbers turn into predictions!
