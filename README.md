# LazyLearningAI
ðŸ’¤ LazyLearningAI: A repository born out of boredom and curiosity, where I attempt to learn AI with minimal effort and maximum confusion. Join me as I lazily stumble through neural networks, machine learning models, and data wranglingâ€”hoping that some of it sticks! Perfect for anyone who wants to learn AI but would rather do it lying down. ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–
